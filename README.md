Source code for generating a simple single page webpage. The design is optimal for displaying structured text content, e.g songs, on handheld devices.

Included here is a small working example. Simple clone the repository and run generateWebPage.py, and a very minimal index.html is generated.

A full-fledged example for a larger database is hosted at markusaspegren.se/sangbok
